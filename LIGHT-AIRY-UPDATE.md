## 📸 WHY THIS WORKS

**Luxury Real Estate Psychology:**
- Bright = Open = Spacious = Valuable
- Light images = aspirational living
- Dark images = moody/dramatic (good for some brands, not for family homes)

**Your Target Market:**
- Corporate relocators want "fresh start"
- Faculty want "peaceful, bright"
- Lifestyle buyers want "resort living"

All respond better to bright, airy visuals.
